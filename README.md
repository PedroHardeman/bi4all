# Hello! My name is Pedro and this is the bi4all tech challenge.

Since it wasn't allowed any kind of framework, I tried to keep as simple as possible.
Also, since the 'https://fakestoreapi.com/' won't return any kind of position, I took the liberty to use the user ID as their position.

For running the project you will need:

- clone
- open the page in your browser

Hope you enjoy it and feel free to contact me about anything! <br />

For the react version go to:
https://github.com/PedroHardeman/bi4all-react

Thank you :wink:
